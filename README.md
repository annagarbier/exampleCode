## [./solLewitt](https://github.com/annagarbier/exampleCode/edit/master/solLewitt)

Sol LeWitt [wrote instructions](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt+wall+drawing+instructions&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS807US807&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk-Py8h_bgAhVCZN8KHZKrBV4Q_AUIDigB&biw=1440&bih=766) for generating drawings. But what would these instructions look like if we weren't creating images, but instead were creating language? Specifically, random little ditties.

## [./nlpDraw](https://github.com/annagarbier/exampleCode/edit/master/nlpDraw)

A lightweight prototype of a language-based drawing tool. This javascript interface accepts natural language text like "draw a big blue square in the top left" or "make a tiny triangle", and returns a corresponding drawing. This is a quick proof-of-concept for potential future work into the relationship between linguistic and visual communication.
