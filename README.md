## If Sol LeWitt Wrote Ditties (./solLewitt)

Sol LeWitt [wrote instructions](https://www.google.com/search?q=sol+lewitt+wall+drawing+instructions&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS807US807&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk-Py8h_bgAhVCZN8KHZKrBV4Q_AUIDigB&biw=1440&bih=766) for generating drawings. But what would these instructions look like if we weren't creating images, but instead were creating ditties?
